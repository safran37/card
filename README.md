Welcome to my simple Card component repository

This component is basically aims to make a simple yet good looking component to be used in projects

This component is scalable with 375px media screen and has a hover effect on it's button

This component is written with HTML,CSS,Javascript,Grid and media queries

Since this was the first component i've ever used Grid it was a quite nice start for me.What this component basically does is it holds a side by side 2 columns but when you check the component in mobile version (375px) Grid lowers it's columns to 1 and makes it an entirely different component.

Before doing this challenges i had no idea <picture> tag does and after i complete the challenge i have come to realise is that <picture> tag could save me quite a lot time.

In the future i'm hoping to change images with picture tags,change some of the font sizes so it can look even better
